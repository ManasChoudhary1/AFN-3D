# AFN-3D
This repo contains AFN-3D repo, which is extension of Affinity Feature strengthening Network (AFN) for 3D tasks. I specifically am desigining this for the Vesuvius Scroll Detection Challenge 2025. So the experimentations, metrics i'll be aiming to optimize, and the results I show, will be based on this kaggle competition.
